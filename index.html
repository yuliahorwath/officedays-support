      <p>Office Days helps you automatically track office visits and plan your hybrid work schedule with complete
   privacy.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>How do I add an office location?</h3>
      <p>Go to the Locations tab, enter your office address or use your current location, then tap "Add
  Location". The app will automatically detect when you arrive at this location.</p>

      <h3>Why isn't my location being tracked?</h3>
      <p>Make sure you have enabled "Always" location permission. Go to Settings → Privacy & Security → Location
  Services → Office Days and select "Always".</p>

      <h3>Is my location data private?</h3>
      <p>Yes! All your location and schedule data is stored only on your device. Nothing is sent to any servers
  or shared with anyone. Your privacy is guaranteed.</p>

      <h3>How do I plan office days in advance?</h3>
      <p>On the Calendar tab, tap dates to select them, then tap a status tile (Office, PTO, Holiday,
  Credit, or WFH) to apply it to the selected days.</p>

      <h3>How do I delete a logged office visit?</h3>
      <p>Go to the Log tab and tap "Delete" next to any entry you want to remove.</p>

      <h3>Can I track multiple office locations?</h3>
      <p>Yes! Add as many office locations as you need in the Locations tab. The app will track visits to any of
  them.</p>
