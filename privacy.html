      <h1>Privacy Policy for Office Days</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2025</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Office Days is designed with your privacy as the top priority. All your data stays on your device. We do
   not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal information or location data.</p>

      <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
      <p>Office Days does not collect any personally identifiable information. The app operates entirely on your
  device.</p>

      <h2>Location Data</h2>
      <p>Office Days uses your device's location services to automatically detect when you arrive at your
  designated office locations. This location data:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Is processed entirely on your device</li>
          <li>Is never transmitted to any servers</li>
          <li>Is never shared with any third parties</li>
          <li>Remains under your complete control</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can revoke location permissions at any time through your device settings.</p>

      <h2>Data Storage</h2>
      <p>All data created by Office Days, including:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Office location addresses and coordinates</li>
          <li>Visit logs and timestamps</li>
          <li>Calendar entries and day statuses</li>
          <li>Personal scheduling information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Is stored locally on your device using secure iOS storage mechanisms. This data is never synchronized to
   external servers or cloud services.</p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Office Days uses Google Places API solely for address autocomplete functionality when you add office
  locations. The only data sent to Google is the partial address text you type. No personally identifiable
  information or location data is transmitted.</p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>Since all your data remains on your device, it is protected by your device's built-in security features,
   including device passcode and iOS encryption.</p>

      <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>You have complete control over your data. You can delete individual log entries within the app, or
  delete all app data by uninstalling Office Days from your device.</p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Office Days does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.</p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an
  updated revision date.</p>
